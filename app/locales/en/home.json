It addresses the issue of analyzing large-scale data in which a microarray experiment of 10,000 proteins would identify 100 proteins by chance using a p-value cut-off of 0.01. Therefore, SAM applies a t-test at the individual gene or protein level to determine whether the expression pattern for that gene or protein is significant."

      "title": "When is it used?",
      "content": "This test is performed when the samples 1) may not be independent of each other and 2) are or are not normally distributed. It can help identify expression patterns that have little difference between the control and test groups but are nevertheless significant."
